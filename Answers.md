State holds the data that we need to store dynamically within the application and change at times

1. What are side effects, and how do you sync effects in a React component to state or prop changes?

A side effect is anything that affects something outside of the scope of a function. An example of syncing side effects is (!state) > something happens, like giving the application time to grab the axios call so it loads on the page.
